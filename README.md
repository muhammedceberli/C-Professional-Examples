## First Example: Detab Implementation
<br>
The first example in this repository is a detab program, which replaces tab characters (\t) with spaces to align text at defined tab stops.
<br>
<br>
### Features
<br>
- Reads user input and processes it.
- Expands tab characters into spaces based on TAB_SIZE.
- Handles various input edge cases.
<br>
<br>
### How It Works
<br>
1. The program reads input from the user.
2. Tabs are expanded into spaces according to the defined TAB_SIZE.
3. The processed output is displayed.
<br>
<br>
### Code Structure
<br>
- getString(): Reads user input, handling buffer limitations and termination conditions.
- detab(): Replaces tabs with spaces while maintaining correct alignment.
- main(): Controls the program flow and user interaction.
<br>
<br>
### Usage
<br>
1. Clone the repository:

<br>
2. Compile the program:

<br>
3. Run the program:

<br>
4. Enter input and observe the detabbed output.
