## First Example: Detab Implementation

The first example in this repository is a detab program, which replaces tab characters (\t) with spaces to align text at defined tab stops.<br><br>


### Features

- Reads user input and processes it.
- Expands tab characters into spaces based on TAB_SIZE.
- Handles various input edge cases.<br><br>


### How It Works

1. The program reads input from the user.
2. Tabs are expanded into spaces according to the defined TAB_SIZE.
3. The processed output is displayed.<br><br>


### Code Structure

- getString(): Reads user input, handling buffer limitations and termination conditions.
- detab(): Replaces tabs with spaces while maintaining correct alignment.
- main(): Controls the program flow and user interaction.<br><br>

  
### Usage

1. Clone the repository:


2. Compile the program:


3. Run the program:


4. Enter input and observe the detabbed output.<br><br><br>
