# C-Professional-Examples
 A collection of well-structured, professional C programming examples with detailed explanations. Each .c file includes a corresponding explanation in the README.md to enhance understanding.



Overview

This repository contains a collection of professional C programming examples. Each example is designed to follow best coding practices and includes a detailed explanation in the README file.



First Example: Detab Implementation

The first example in this repository is a detab program, which replaces tab characters (\t) with spaces to align text at defined tab stops.


Features

- Reads user input and processes it.
- Expands tab characters into spaces based on TAB_SIZE.
- Handles various input edge cases.


How It Works

1. The program reads input from the user.
2. Tabs are expanded into spaces according to the defined TAB_SIZE.
3. The processed output is displayed.


Code Structure

- getString(): Reads user input, handling buffer limitations and termination conditions.
- detab(): Replaces tabs with spaces while maintaining correct alignment.
- main(): Controls the program flow and user interaction.


Usage

1. Clone the repository:

2. Compile the program:

3. Run the program:

4. Enter input and observe the detabbed output.
